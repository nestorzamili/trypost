 * on. This subscribes to it, resolves exactly one outcome, and leaves the
 * channel again.
 *
 * It settles at most once, into exactly one of three outcomes: the post is
 * ready, the generation failed, or the wait was abandoned without an answer.
 * The first of the event, a refused subscription and the timeout wins; every
 * later one is dropped. That matters because the event can arrive before
 * `subscribePrivateChannel` has even resolved, and arming the timeout
 * afterwards would later abandon a generation that already succeeded.
 *
 * Cleanup is registered on the calling component's unmount, because the chat
 * mounts and unmounts one of these per generation card as a conversation is
 * scrolled and reopened — a leaked subscription per card is not the same
 * cost it was on the single-use loading screen.

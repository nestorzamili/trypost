                    Shallow-copied, not passed by reference: the `ai` package's
                    UI message stream reducer mutates a tool part's own
                    properties in place (`part.state = ...`, see

                    already rebuilt fresh per render (see the comment on
                    `renderedMessages` in `pages/chat/Index.vue`), but that
                    only gives a new *array*; the individual part object
                    inside it is still the same reference across state
                    transitions. Vue's prop diffing skips re-rendering a
                    child when a prop's reference is unchanged, so
                    `ChatToolPart` would otherwise never see a tool call
                    move from "running" to its resolved state.

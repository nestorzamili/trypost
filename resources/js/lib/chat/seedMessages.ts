 *
 * A separate limitation: `ConversationMessageResource` does not expose
 * whether any of a message's calls are still awaiting approval
 * (`approval_state.pending` isn't part of the resource). A call with no
 * stored result — e.g. a write tool paused for approval when the tab was
 * closed — replays with an empty `output`, which `ChatToolPart` renders as
 * "this result couldn't be read" rather than a live approval prompt the
 * user could act on. Reconstructing that would need the resource to expose
 * `approval_state`, which is outside this change's file scope.

 * Every line the post-generation card renders, resolved server-side in the
 * language of the conversation rather than the language of the interface.
 *
 * The card is the only place in the app where those two can differ: the
 * assistant answers in whatever language the user is writing in
 * (`resources/views/prompts/conversation/assistant.blade.php`), so a card
 * translated by the client's own locale bindings would put two languages in
 * one thread. The lines therefore travel with the payload, and the card does
 * no translation lookup of its own.
 *
 * Lines carrying `:placeholders` are shipped as templates — the card fills
 * `:account`, `:max`, `:count` and the sentence's own parts client-side, from
 * values only it has.

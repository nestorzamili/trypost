/**
 * Deleting a draft is reversible in every sense that matters — nothing has
 * gone out anywhere — so it runs straight through. A post that's already
 * live on a platform ({@see PostStatusRules::blocksDeletion()} — the same
 * rule the web UI enforces) can never actually be deleted, so there's
 * nothing to approve: refuse immediately and say why, rather than asking
 * the user to confirm an action that's going to fail regardless of their
 * answer. Approval is reserved for the one case it's meaningful — a
 * scheduled or failed post, where confirming genuinely cancels something
 * that would otherwise still happen. The same reasoning covers the role
 * gate: a member the workspace policy refuses is never asked to confirm a
 * deletion {@see WorkspaceTool::writeDenied()} will refuse anyway.

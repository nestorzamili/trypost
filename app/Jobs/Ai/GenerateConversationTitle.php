     * The reliable signal that a model wrapped its answer in a preamble is
     * that it double-quoted the answer, so extraction only fires in two
     * narrow, unambiguous shapes (see extractQuoted()): the entire response
     * is one quoted segment, or the response ends with a colon followed by a
     * quoted segment. Anything else is used as-is. An apostrophe or single
     * quote is never treated as a quote delimiter — pairing arbitrary
     * apostrophes (e.g. two contractions anywhere in the response) matches
     * the wrong span and corrupts the title. A leading-word-list heuristic
     * ("Sure!", "Here's...") was also tried and rejected: it damages
     * legitimate titles that start with one of those words followed by a
     * colon (e.g. "Okay Computer: A Retrospective"). An occasionally chatty
     * title is a far better failure than a silently corrupted one.
     *
     * Wrapping quotes and trailing punctuation are trimmed with a
     * Unicode-aware regex, never `trim()`'s byte-wise charlist — passing
     * multi-byte characters to `trim()` corrupts adjacent multi-byte text
     * (e.g. CJK) whose bytes happen to collide with the charlist bytes.
